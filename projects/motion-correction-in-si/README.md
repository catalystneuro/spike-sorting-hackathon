## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objectives

Motion of the probe has been a major impediment to high quality spike sorting on high density probes such as the Neuropixel probe. Recent developments in preprocessing have displayed promising results for solving this issue, but these algorithms are varied, complex, and multi-step. Here, we are incorporating these motion correction methods into SpikeInterface so that they are easier for users to access. The motion correction process can be summarized in the following steps: 

Using action potentials:
1. detect peak
2. localize peaks
    1. center of mass
    2. monopolar triangulation
3. motion estimation
    1. rigid or non-rigid
    2. decentralize
    3. motion cloud
