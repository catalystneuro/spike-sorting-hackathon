## Dates and Location

- April 14th, 5pm CET: SpikeInterface lesson (virtual)
- May 12th, 5pm CET: Pre-hackathon project pitch session (virtual)

- **Hackathon Dates:** June 6 - 10
- **Location:** Flatiron Institute, 162 5th Ave, New York, NY 10010

## Overview

This event aims to bring together spike sorting developers and experts to tackle open and unsolved spike sorting 
issues and to move the spike sorting field forward in an open and highly collaborative fashion.

Given the fast-paced and constantly evolving neurotechnology that is becoming increasingly available to 
neuroscientists across the globe, we believe that the spike sorting community should join forces to find 
novel and scalable solutions for fully reproducible and accurate spike sorting in the years to come.

In light of the recent efforts for standardization and unification of spike sorting software (especially with the 
[SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and 
[SpikeForest](https://spikeforest.flatironinstitute.org/) projects), this hackaton is expected to provide a 
tangible contribution to the electrophysiology field to make new and integrate existing tools for the community.

Come join the developers of popular spike sorting tools including YASS, SpikeInterface, SpyKING CIRCUS, Mountainsort, and many more!

## Registration

The event will be in a hybrid format. We have reached capacity for on-site participants, but anyone is welcome to join remotely.

Please complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeDq6xN5panK_bTCypUDw5gbXmJosWkSlRJA5Rb8-Lnyq6HBA/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that we can send you announcements about the event.

## Preparation

In order to maximize the output of the Hackathon, we invite all participants to familiarize with the SpikeInterface 
framework. An introductory tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spiketutorials/tree/master/Official_Tutorial_SI_0.90_Aug2021).

In addition, we invite the participants to the following virtual pre-events:

### April 14th at 5-6:30 pm CET: Advanced SpikeInterface tutorial for developers

Alessio and Samuel will lead an internal and technical walkthrough of SpikeInterface. This presentation is intended to help potential contributors of the projects.

Meeting ID: 946 3372 8053

### May 12th, 5-6:30 pm CET: Hackathon project round-table

Each project will be invited to give a 2-5 minute presentation. We will discuss and self-organize around projects we want to develop, refining teams and objectives for each project.

Please contact us to receive the respective passcodes.

Also remember that we still have the recurring monthly meeting on spike sorting modularization every first Monday of the month. Anyone is invited to attend and optionally present recent advances on methods for spike sorting. Contact us in case you
would like to be added to the recurring meeting mailing list.

## Projects

We will be organizing our goals for the hackathon around Projects, which can be submitted to this website via GitHub. 
All participants are encouraged to start a new project or join an existing project. For questions, discussions, and ideas,
do not hesitate to open issues on the event [GitHub page](https://github.com/catalystneuro/spike-sorting-hackathon)
